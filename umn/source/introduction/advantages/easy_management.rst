Easy Management
===============

Instant Availability
--------------------

You can get a DB instance from the management console within minutes and access RDS through an ECS to reduce the application response time and save the traffic fees for public access.

Elastic Scaling
---------------

Cloud Eye monitors the changes of database pressure and data storage. You can flexibly scale resources accordingly and pay for only what you use.

High Compatibility
------------------

The methods of using RDS database engines (DB engines) are the same as those of using native engines. RDS is compatible with existing programs and tools.

Easy O&M
--------

Routine RDS maintenance and management operations, including hardware and software fault handling and database patch updates, are easy to perform. With a web-based console, you can reboot DB instances, reset passwords, modify parameters, view error or slow query logs, and restore data. Additionally, the system helps you monitor DB instances in real time and generates alarms if an error occurs. You can check DB instance information at any time, including CPU usage, IOPS, database connections, and storage space usage.
