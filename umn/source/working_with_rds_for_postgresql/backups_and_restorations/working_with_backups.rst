Working with Backups
====================

RDS supports backups and restorations to ensure data reliability.

Automated Backups
-----------------

Automated backups are created during the backup time window of your DB instances. RDS saves automated backups based on the retention period you specified. If necessary, you can restore to any point in time during your backup retention period.

Manual Backups
--------------

Manual backups are user-initiated full backups of DB instances. They are retained until you delete them manually.
