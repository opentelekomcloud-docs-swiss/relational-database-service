Can I Use a Template to Create DB Instances?
============================================

You can quickly create a DB instance with the same configurations as an existing DB instance.

-  For RDS for MySQL instances, see :ref:`Creating a Same DB Instance as an Existing DB Instance <rds_05_0055>`.
-  For RDS for PostgreSQL instances, see :ref:`Creating a Same DB Instance as an Existing DB Instance <rds_pg_05_0055>`.
-  For RDS for SQL Server instances, see :ref:`Creating a Same DB Instance as an Existing DB Instance <rds_sqlserver_05_0055>`.
