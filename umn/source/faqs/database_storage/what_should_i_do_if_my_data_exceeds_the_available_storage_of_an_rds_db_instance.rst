What Should I Do If My Data Exceeds the Available Storage of an RDS DB Instance?
================================================================================

Scenario
--------

The database storage space of an RDS DB instance is exhausted, and applications cannot read data from or write data to databases, interrupting services.

Cause
-----

#. Data occupies a great amount of storage.
#. A large number of binlog files are generated due to a large number of transactions and write operations.
#. A large number of temporary files are generated due to a large number of sorting queries executed by applications.

Solution
--------

#. If data occupies too much storage space, run **DROP**, **TRUNCATE**, or **DELETE**\ +\ **OPTIMIZE TABLE** to delete useless historical table data to free up storage space. If no historical data can be deleted, scale up your storage space.
#. If binlog files occupy too much storage space, contact technical support to delete local binlog files to free up storage space.
#. If temporary files generated by sorting queries take up too much storage space, optimize your SQL query statements.
#. If none of the preceding solutions work, use database and table sharding.
