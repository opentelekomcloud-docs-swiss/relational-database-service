Why Is a Table or Data Missing from My Database?
================================================

RDS does not delete or perform any operations on any user data. If this problem occurs, check if there have been any misoperations and restore the data from backup files, if necessary.

Possible solutions are as follows:

-  Use the RDS restoration function to restore data.
-  Import the backup data to RDS through an ECS.
